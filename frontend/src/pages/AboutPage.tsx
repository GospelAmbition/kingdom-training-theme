                Kingdom.Training focuses on practical training for Media to Disciple Making Movements (M2DMM). 
                We are field workers with a heart for the unreached and least-reached peoples of the world, 
                and our passion is to equip disciple makers with strategic media tools that bridge online 
                engagement with face-to-face discipleship.
              </p>
              <p>
                We operate within what we call the &ldquo;Heavenly Economy&rdquo;—a principle that challenges 
                the broken world&apos;s teaching that &ldquo;the more you get, the more you should keep.&rdquo; 
                Instead, we reflect God&apos;s generous nature by offering free training, hands-on coaching, 
                and open-source tools.

              <p>
                Like the men of Issachar who understood the times, we equip disciple makers to use media 
                strategically—identifying spiritual seekers online and connecting them with face-to-face 
                disciplers who help them discover, obey, and share all that Jesus taught.

                  Trained responders dialogue with seekers online, identifying persons of peace ready for
